Hi, I'm [Nigel D'Souza](http://nigeldsouza.io), a developer and tech enthusiast, currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at DePaul University.
I love learning new concepts, technologies and meeting new people. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, video games, dancing, skating, drumming and all outdoor activities.
